            Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing

                      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as
                      canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                      animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have
                      occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                      animals and then spread to people. More information about the <span class="selected">source and

                      This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were
                      linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s
                      important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly
                      contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                      Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC
                      recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how
                      sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.</p>
                    <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from
                      isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and
                      control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation

                    <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory
                      droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
                      Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                      20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,
                      coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                    <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the
                      virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
                      thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                    <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely
                      very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or
                      weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as
                      canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                      animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have
                      occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                      animals and then spread to people. More information about the <span class="selected">source and

                      This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were
                      linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s
                      important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly
                      contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                      Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC

                    <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from
                      isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and

                      Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                      20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,

                      thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                    <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely
                      very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or

                    People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by
                    learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or
                    ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.

                    <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or
                      visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and
                      anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people
                      who were in quarantine.</p>
                    <p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                      associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears
                      about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p>
                    <p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the
                      disease that is causing the problem.</p>
