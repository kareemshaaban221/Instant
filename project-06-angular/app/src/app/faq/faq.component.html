                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as
                    canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                    animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have
                    occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                    Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                    animals and then spread to people. More information about the <span class="selected">source and

                    This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were
                    linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s
                    important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly
                    contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                    Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,

                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as
                    canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                    animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have
                    occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                    Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                    animals and then spread to people. More information about the <span class="selected">source and

                  <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory
                    droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
                    Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose,
                    coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                  <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the
                    virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
                    thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                  <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely
                    very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or
                    weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>
